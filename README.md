# Selenium-Soup
Hello, this is just a personal collection of codes that I will upload as I come across situations where I have to ask the assistance of automations to help me to boring work. 

As the name implies. I will primarily using Selenium and BeautifulSoup to automate. 

I hope to make this repository public if my collection grows, sharing whatever knowledge I gathered about random websites here. They are all publically available, including the data they have, so no illegal business here. Also, I will aim to make all my code accessible for everyone. However, they will only be in Python, so no accessibility points there.

Have fun using this repository to learn or guide yourselves. Always open for improvements in my code.

Happy Automating!
